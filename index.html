⚡ GoWild in 30 Seconds — The Rules of the Road
▼
💰
What You Pay
$0.01 airfare + taxes/fees per flight. Domestic total: ~$7-15. International total: ~$30-80+. That's it — no hidden fare buckets.
📅
Booking Windows
Domestic: opens 1 day before departure. International: opens 10 days before. Early Booking available for a small extra fee.
🔒
Must Be Logged In
GoWild fares only appear when you're logged into your FRONTIER Miles account on flyfrontier.com. No login = no $0.01 fares.
🎒
Bags Aren't Free
Only a personal item (14x18x8") is included. Carry-on: ~$40-60. Checked bag: ~$35-55. Always buy bags online — gate prices are brutal.
💺
Seats: Luck of the Draw
No free seat selection. You're assigned at check-in. Pay $6-15 for standard or $15-50+ for Stretch. Elite Status gets free picks.
🚫
Blackout Dates
~60 days/year are blacked out around holidays and peak travel. Check the calendar on this page — red dates = no GoWild.
⚠️
Never No-Show
Always cancel before departure if plans change. Repeated no-shows = penalties or pass revocation without refund. It takes 30 seconds in the app.
💡
Pro Tips
Check at midnight when domestic opens. Tue/Wed have best availability. Saturday is key for most int'l routes. Have backup destinations ready.
